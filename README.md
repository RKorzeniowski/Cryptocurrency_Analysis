# Cryptocurrency_Analysis

Python code aming to find out which data has power to predict altcoin price patterns and building RNN model based on this data.

Price_Correlation.py downloads and processes the data that are needed for RNN. Correlations calculated there can also be used to visualize(heatmap) how different altcoins are connected.

Data folder contains some data like ammount of google searches that are not yet downloaded by Price_Correlation.py but are usefull for further analysis. 

This project has many different versions of RNN used to predict prices of altcoins and thier performance will be rated according to thier performance.
